However, there's room for improvement in the clarity and conciseness of explanations, particularly regarding the absence of pointers.  The candidate correctly identifies the role of garbage collection, but the explanation lacks precision and flows poorly. A stronger candidate would provide more structured and precise answers, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</p>\n                                    <div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-6 gap-8 my-8\" id=\"scoreDonuts\">\n                                        <div class=\"flex flex-col items-center\">\n                                            <canvas id=\"donutRelevance\" width=\"111\" height=\"111\" style=\"display: block; box-sizing: border-box; height: 88px; width: 88px;\"></canvas>\n                                            <div class=\"mt-2 text-center text-sm font-semibold\">Relevance of Tech</div>\n                                        </div>\n                                        <div class=\"flex flex-col items-center\">\n                                            <canvas id=\"donutConfidence\" width=\"111\" height=\"111\" style=\"display: block; box-sizing: border-box; height: 88px; width: 88px;\"></canvas>\n                                            <div class=\"mt-2 text-center text-sm font-semibold\">Confidence</div>\n                                        </div>\n                                        <div class=\"flex flex-col items-center\">\n                                            <canvas id=\"donutCommunication\" width=\"111\" height=\"111\" style=\"display: block; box-sizing: border-box; height: 88px; width: 88px;\"></canvas>\n                                            <div class=\"mt-2 text-center text-sm font-semibold\">Communication</div>\n                                        </div>\n                                        <div class=\"flex flex-col items-center\">\n                                            <canvas id=\"donutClarity\" width=\"111\" height=\"111\" style=\"display: block; box-sizing: border-box; height: 88px; width: 88px;\"></canvas>\n                                            <div class=\"mt-2 text-center text-sm font-semibold\">Clarity</div>\n                                        </div>\n                                        <div class=\"flex flex-col items-center\">\n                                            <canvas id=\"donutProblemSolving\" width=\"111\" height=\"111\" style=\"display: block; box-sizing: border-box; height: 88px; width: 88px;\"></canvas>\n                                            <div class=\"mt-2 text-center text-sm font-semibold\">Problem-Solving</div>\n                                        </div>\n                                        <div class=\"flex flex-col items-center\">\n                                            <canvas id=\"donutTechnicalKnowledge\" width=\"111\" height=\"111\" style=\"display: block; box-sizing: border-box; height: 88px; width: 88px;\"></canvas>\n                                            <div class=\"mt-2 text-center text-sm font-semibold\">Technical Knowledge</div>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                            <!-- Per-question grading -->\n                            \n                            <details class=\"mt-4\">\n                                <summary class=\"cursor-pointer text-lg font-semibold mb-2\">Show Per-Question Grading</summary>\n                                <div class=\"overflow-x-auto mt-2\">\n                                    <table class=\"min-w-full text-sm border border-gray-200 rounded\">\n                                        <thead>\n                                            <tr class=\"bg-gray-100\">\n                                                <th class=\"px-3 py-2 border-b text-left\">Question</th>\n                                                <th class=\"px-3 py-2 border-b text-left\">Candidate Answer</th>\n                                                <th class=\"px-3 py-2 border-b text-left\">Score</th>\n                                                <th class=\"px-3 py-2 border-b text-left\">Explanation</th>\n                                            </tr>\n                                        </thead>\n                                        <tbody>\n                                            \n                                            <tr>\n                                                <td class=\"px-3 py-2 border-b align-top\">How would you rate yourself in Java out of 10?</td>\n                                                <td class=\"px-3 py-2 border-b align-top\">I think I rate myself a 6.5 out of 10 in Java.</td>\n                                                <td class=\"px-3 py-2 border-b align-top font-bold text-blue-600\">7/10</td>\n                                                <td class=\"px-3 py-2 border-b align-top\">Honest self-assessment.
