However, the candidate's experience is significantly less than the required 4-7 years (only 3 years stated).  Furthermore, the resume lacks mention of several crucial technologies listed as 'need to have' in the job description, such as RESTful web services, JSON, and HTML5.  While the candidate mentions working with web forms and some experience with frontend technologies,  the depth and breadth of experience in these areas are unclear and don't meet the requirements of a 4-7 year experienced developer, especially one with Azure and legacy technology experience.  The resume also shows experience with Python and React, which are 'nice to have', but the core .NET skills and experience levels are insufficient to warrant a higher match percentage.</p>\n                        </div><div class=\"mb-4 p-4 border border-blue-100 rounded\">\n                            <p><strong>java-developer-resume-example.pdf</strong></p>\n                            <p><strong>Resume Match:</strong> <span class=\"font-bold text-blue-600\">25%</span></p>\n                            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Nadia's resume shows strong Java and front-end skills (AngularJS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS),  and some experience with SQL.  However, the job description heavily emphasizes .NET technologies (ASP.NET, MVC, C#, WCF, Entity Framework), Azure, and experience with legacy systems (VB scripting, Python). Nadia's experience is primarily in Java, with limited exposure to the technologies central to this role. While she possesses some transferable skills like software development lifecycle experience and database familiarity, the core technical requirements are not met.  The requested 4-7 years experience in .NET is entirely absent.  Therefore, a low match percentage is appropriate.</p>\n                        </div>",
