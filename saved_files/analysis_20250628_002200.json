While the resume shows experience with ASP.NET, MVC, C#, Entity Framework, and SQL Server – all needed skills – the experience is limited to only 3 years total, significantly less than the 4-7 years required.  Furthermore, the job description emphasizes experience with RESTful web services, WCF, Azure, and legacy technologies like VB scripting, none of which are explicitly mentioned on the resume. The candidate's experience with Python and React is in a different context than what the job requires. While the resume lists HTML, JavaScript, and CSS,  the job description seeks expertise in HTML5. The lack of experience with the required technologies and the significant shortfall in years of experience heavily reduce the match percentage.</p>\n                        </div><div class=\"mb-4 p-4 border border-blue-100 rounded\">\n                            <p><strong>Java_Developer_JD.docx</strong></p>\n                            <p><strong>Resume Match:</strong> <span class=\"font-bold text-blue-600\">25%</span></p>\n                            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The resume highlights a strong Java/Spring Boot background, which is not the primary focus of the job description. While the job description mentions Java/Hybris as a recent addition and a growing area, the core requirements revolve around .NET technologies (ASP.NET, MVC, WCF, Entity Framework) and SQL Server.  The resume's emphasis on microservices, reactive programming, and specific Java frameworks (Spring Boot, Hibernate) doesn't strongly align with the listed .NET needs.  Although both roles involve web application development and require similar soft skills (communication, problem-solving), the technical skills mismatch significantly lowers the match percentage. The experience level aligns, but the technology stack is fundamentally different.</p>\n                        </div>",
