  "resumeHTML": "<div class=\"mb-4 p-4 border border-blue-100 rounded\">\n                            <p><strong>Dotnet_JD.docx</strong></p>\n                            <p><strong>Resume Match:</strong> <span class=\"font-bold text-blue-600\">65%</span></p>\n                            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The resume is missing, preventing a full assessment.  However, based on the job description alone, a candidate would need significant experience with .NET technologies (ASP.NET, MVC, WCF), RESTful services, SQL Server, and ideally some experience with newer technologies like .NET Core, Azure, and potentially Java/Hybris, given the company's stated expansion into those areas.  A match percentage of 65% reflects the expectation that a strong candidate will possess many of these skills;  the lack of a resume prevents a precise evaluation of the specific candidate's skills.  The required experience level (4-7 years) is also a factor that would need to be assessed against the resume's work history.  The lack of information on the candidate's proficiency in AngularJS, specifically mentioned in the job description, further lowers the potential match percentage.  If the resume demonstrates proficiency in most of the 'need to have' skills and some of the 'nice to have' skills, along with the relevant experience, the match percentage could be significantly higher.</p>\n                        </div><div class=\"mb-4 p-4 border border-blue-100 rounded\">\n                            <p><strong>Aameer A Resume.docx</strong></p>\n                            <p><strong>Resume Match:</strong> <span class=\"font-bold text-blue-600\">40%</span></p>\n                            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The candidate's resume demonstrates some relevant skills but falls short in several key areas required by the job description.  While the candidate possesses experience with ASP.NET, MVC, C#, Entity Framework, and SQL Server,  the experience level is significantly less than the required 4-7 years, and specifically lacks the depth in WCF and REST services explicitly mentioned.  The resume highlights experience with only 3 years and the projects listed (Data Migration Tools and Admin Console for AI ChatBot) are not clearly aligned with enterprise web application development, which is the core focus of the role.  Additionally, the job description emphasizes experience with legacy applications (VB scripting, Python etc.) and Azure, neither of which are prominently featured in the resume.  While the candidate lists some frontend technologies (React, Vue) and Python, the job description heavily prioritizes .NET skills, particularly experience within the full software development lifecycle within an enterprise setting.  The candidateâ€™s skills align with roughly 40% of the required skills and experience level; therefore, a 40% match is appropriate.</p>\n                        </div>",
