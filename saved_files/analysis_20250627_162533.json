However, several key discrepancies significantly lower the match percentage. The candidate lacks the required 4-7 years of experience, only showing 3 years.  The resume highlights experience with Python and React, which are 'nice-to-haves' but doesn't showcase the extensive experience in .NET technologies (specifically WCF and RESTful services) as explicitly demanded by the job description.  The description emphasizes collaboration and working within a larger team to analyze business requirements and design solutions, while the resume focuses more on individual tasks and less on the collaborative aspects.  The lack of experience with technologies like Azure and  HTML5, which are mentioned as important and even 'needs to have' items also impacts the match significantly. The candidate's experience with legacy systems (VB scripting, etc.) is also not mentioned.</p>\n                        </div><div class=\"mb-4 p-4 border border-blue-100 rounded\">\n                            <p><strong>Aameer A Resume.docx</strong></p>\n                            <p><strong>Resume Match:</strong> <span class=\"font-bold text-blue-600\">40%</span></p>\n                            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The candidate's resume demonstrates some alignment with the job description, particularly in their skills with ASP.NET, MVC, C#, and SQL Server.  However, several key discrepancies significantly lower the match percentage.  The candidate only has 3 years of experience, falling short of the required 4-7 years.  Crucially, the resume lacks any mention of experience with RESTful web services, WCF, Azure, or any legacy technologies (VB scripting, Python etc.), all of which are explicitly stated as 'Need to Have' skills. While the candidate lists experience with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, the job description emphasizes HTML5 specifically. The use of Python and React in their recent role, while showcasing adaptability, doesn't directly address the core .NET focus of the job.  Finally, the resume lacks demonstrable experience in the full software development lifecycle as described.  While the candidate possesses some relevant skills, the experience level and missing key required skills significantly reduce their suitability for this role.</p>\n                        </div>",
