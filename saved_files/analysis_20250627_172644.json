While he possesses experience with ASP.NET, MVC, C#, Entity Framework, and SQL Server, his experience is only 3 years, significantly less than the required 4-7 years.  The job description heavily emphasizes experience with RESTful web services, WCF, and Azure, which are only minimally touched upon in the resume.  Furthermore, the resume lacks mention of experience with HTML5, jQuery, or legacy technologies like VB scriptingâ€”all listed as 'need to have' or 'nice to have' skills in the job description.  The resume shows recent work with Python and React, which aren't explicitly mentioned in the job description, and doesn't highlight experience with the full software development lifecycle, especially in a .NET context, as emphasized in the description.  His experience with database design and optimization isn't detailed sufficiently. Overall, while Aameer has a foundation in some necessary technologies, the lack of experience depth and specific skills needed makes him a less-than-ideal candidate.</p>\n                        </div>",
