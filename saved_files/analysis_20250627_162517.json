While the resume highlights experience with ASP.NET, MVC, C#, Entity Framework, and SQL Server, which are all 'need to have' skills, the candidate's experience is only 3 years, significantly less than the required 4-7 years.  Furthermore, the resume lacks mention of crucial technologies listed in the job description such as RESTful web services, WCF,  Azure,  JSON, and experience with legacy applications (VB Scripting, Python). The experience with Python and React is in a different context than what the job description demands (a chatbot, not enterprise web applications). The candidate's experience with HTML5 and jQuery is minimal and not explicitly stated, merely implied.  The focus on Winforms and Console applications is not aligned with the job's emphasis on web application development. While the candidate possesses some relevant skills, the lack of sufficient experience and absence of several critical technologies significantly reduces the match percentage.</p>\n                        </div>",
